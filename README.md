THE WORLD BANK DATASET WAS DOWNLOADED FROM THE WORLD BANK DATA WEBSITE. I USED MY HOME COUNTRY NIGERIA GDP DATA TO CREATE A VISUALIZATION OF THE COUNTRY'S GROWTH FROM 1990 TO DATE
I USED R PROGRAMMING TO ANALYSE THE DATA
I MADE USE OF THE TIDYVERSE PACKAGE, I CLEANED, FILTERED, AND PIVOTED THE DATA SET
THEN USING GGPLOT I CREATE A VISUALIZATION OF THE DATA SET TO TELL THE STORY
THE GDP GROWTH IN NIGERIA WAS STEADY AND ON THE UPRISE FROM 1990 TO 2013
HOWEVER, WE BEGAN TO SEE A DECLINE FROM 2014 TO DATE. THE TREND STILL SHOWS A DECLINE TO COME IN THE FOLLOWING YEARS
POPULATION GROWTH HAS BEEN STEADY AND INCREASING
GDP PER CAPITA BEGAN RISING IN 2000 AND REACHED AN ALL-TIME HIGH OF $3000 BUT DUE TO NATIONAL AND GLOBAL ECONOMIC DECLINE THE NATION'S CURRENT GDP RANGES AROUND $2000 - $22000 WITH  FURTHER DECLINE IN MIND
WITH THE STEADY GROWTH IN POPULATION AND DECLINE IN GDP per capita, THE POVERTY RATE IN NIGERIA IS ONLY GOING TO INCREASE. 
CONSIDERING THE SHIFT OF HUMAN CAPITAL FROM MOTHER LAND TO FOREIGN LAND, THE RATE OF DEVELOPMENT IS WOUNDED
THE NIGERIA GOVERNMENT SHOULD CONSIDER OTHER RESOURCES THAT PROVE TO BE OF ECONOMIC BENEFITS RATHER THEN OIL AND ALSO CREATE POLICIES THAT SUPPORT AND ENABLE THEIR CITIZENS
